# Diagnose stroke using the KNN algorithm
This project uses the KNN algorithm to predict the risk of raids based on medical data.
## Description
This project is part of the research and application of machine learning in medicine. We are using the KNN algorithm to build a system to help predict stroke risk based on clinical and medical data.
Our goal was to develop a simple and useful tool that would improve the diagnosis and treatment of stroke. We hope this project will bring positive results in providing accurate and timely predictions for patients.

The project "Diagnose stroke using the KNN algorithm" has successfully built a classification model based on the K-NN algorithm that can be used to support stroke diagnosis. collapse. This model has been found to be highly accurate, with an overall accuracy on the test data set of 95%.
The high accuracy of this model shows that the K-NN algorithm can be a useful tool to support stroke diagnosis. This model can be used to help doctors more quickly and accurately diagnose stroke, thereby helping to improve treatment effectiveness for patients.
