# Diagnose stroke using the KNN algorithm
This project uses the KNN algorithm to predict the risk of raids based on medical data.
## Description
This project is part of the research and application of machine learning in medicine. We are using the KNN algorithm to build a system to help predict stroke risk based on clinical and medical data.
Our goal was to develop a simple and useful tool that would improve the diagnosis and treatment of stroke. We hope this project will bring positive results in providing accurate and timely predictions for patients.
